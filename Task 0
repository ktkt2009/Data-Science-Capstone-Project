In this capstone we will be applying data science in the area of natural language processing. 
We have to be familiar with Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and the associated tools in R. 

Resources
	•	Natural language processing Wikipedia page
	•	Text mining infrastucture in R
	•	CRAN Task View: Natural Language Processing
	•	Coursera course on NLP 

Dataset
Download the data from the Coursera site:
	•	Capstone Dataset- final

It was named LOCALE.blogs.txt where LOCALE is the each of the four locales en_US, de_DE, ru_RU and fi_FI. 
The data is from a corpus called HC Corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org). 
The files have been language filtered but may still contain some foreign text.
These data set would be used to explore the data and model building.

Tasks to accomplish
	1	Obtaining the data -download the data and load/manipulate it in R
	2	Familiarizing yourself with NLP and text mining 

Questions to consider
	1	What do the data look like?
	2	Where do the data come from?
	3	Can you think of any other data sources that might help you in this project?
	4	What are the common steps in natural language processing?
	5	What are some common issues in the analysis of text data?
	6	What is the relationship between NLP and the concepts you have learned in the Specialization?
